    <p class="seven">
        The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been
        bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep.The breed was used by
        the France Army AS sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers
        because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War 
        almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is 
        slowly recovering. <br/>
        Chariemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.
